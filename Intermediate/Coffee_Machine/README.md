# Coffee Machine Interactive Project
Welcome to the Coffee Machine Interactive Project, which is programmed in Python using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles!

## Project Overview
This project simulates a coffee machine where you can order your favorite coffee, insert coins, and receive a freshly brewed cup in return.

## How It Works
1. Place Your Order: Choose a coffee from the menu.
2. Insert Coins: Feed the machine with coins, which will be automatically converted into dollars.
3. Payment Processing: Your payment is added to the machine's profit, and any change due will be returned to you.
4. Resource Management: The machine uses its resources (like water, coffee beans, and milk) to prepare your order. Keep an eye on the resource levels and order early to avoid any shortages!
5. Order Fulfillment: If resources are sufficient, you get your coffee. If not, your payment is refunded and the order is canceled.

## Key Features
- Interactive Menu: Easily select your desired coffee from a variety of options.
- Real-time Coin Conversion: Insert coins and see your total amount in dollars.
- Dynamic Resource Management: The machine tracks and updates resource levels with each order.
- Automated Change Return: Any excess payment is promptly returned to you.
