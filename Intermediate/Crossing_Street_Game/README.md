# Crossing the Street Game Project

Welcome to the Crossing the Street Game Project! This project has been programmed in Python using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

## Project Overview

This project recreates the "Crossing the Street" game in which the player controls a turtle using the keyboard to move it up the screen, attempting to cross a street filled with moving cars. Each successful crossing increases the player's level and the game's difficulty.

## Key Features

🔑 Keyboard Controls: Simple and responsive control using the "Up" arrow key.

🔑 Randomized Cars: Cars are represented by square blocks of random colors moving across the screen.

🔑 Level Progression: The game increases in difficulty with each successful crossing by increasing the cars speed.

🔑 Collision Detection: Accurate collision detection between the turtle and the cars.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script to start the game:
    
   ```bash
    python send_quotes.py
    ```

4. Use the "Up" arrow key to control the turtle and cross the street without colliding with the cars.

## *Safe Crossing!* 🤞🏻
