# Flashcard Game Project

Welcome to the Flashcard Game! This project is an interactive flashcard game designed to help users learn French vocabulary by matching French words with their English equivalents. It is built using Python, Tkinter, and Pandas.

## Project Overview

This project displays a French word for three seconds, followed by its English translation. Users can indicate whether they correctly guessed the English word by pressing a check mark or a cross mark button. Correctly guessed words are removed from the flashcards and saved to a new file, while the game continues with the remaining words.

## Key Features

- Graphical User Interface: Interactive and user-friendly interface built with `tkinter`.

- Random Flashcards: French words are randomly picked from a list of French-English word pairs.

- User Interaction: Users respond with check mark or cross mark buttons to indicate if they guessed correctly.

- Data Persistence: Correctly guessed words are removed from the flashcards and saved to a file for future reference.
