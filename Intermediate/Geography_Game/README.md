# Geography Game Project

Welcome to the Geography Game Project! This project uses Python's Turtle graphics library.

## Project Overview

This project mimics the classic "Guess the US States" game. The player inputs the names of US states, and if the guess is correct, the state name is displayed on the map and the guesses score increases. At the end of the game, the states that were not guessed are saved to a CSV file for review.

## How It Works

1. Game Start: The game displays a blank map of the United States.

2. Guess the State: The player types the name of a US state.

3. Correct Guess: If the guess is correct, the state name is displayed on the map, and the guesses score increases.

4. Incorrect Guess: If the guess is incorrect, the player is prompted to try again.

5. Game End: When the player chooses to exit the game, a CSV file is generated containing the names of the states that were not guessed.
