# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Project

Welcome to the NATO Phonetic Alphabet Project! This project uses Python and pandas library.

## Project Overview

This project reads the NATO phonetic alphabet from a CSV file and converts it into a dictionary. When the user inputs a word, the program translates each letter of the word into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet code word.

## How It Works

1. **Read CSV File**: The program reads a CSV file containing the letters and their corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet code words using the pandas library.


2. **Create Dictionary**: The data is converted into a dictionary where each letter is a key and its corresponding code word is the value.


3. **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter a word.


4. **Convert to Phonetic Alphabet**: The program converts each letter of the input word to its NATO phonetic alphabet equivalent using the dictionary.


5. **Output Result**: The program outputs the phonetic code words representing each letter of the user input.

## How to Use

- Clone this repository to your local machine.

- Navigate to the project directory.

- Install "pandas" library if not installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

- Run the Python script to start the game:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
