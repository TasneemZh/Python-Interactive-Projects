# Pong Game Project

Welcome to the Pong Game Project! This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics library.

## Project Overview

This project recreates the classic Pong game where two paddles compete to catch a bouncing ball. Each time a paddle successfully catches the ball, a point is added to the player's score. The game ends when the ball escapes past a paddle.

## How It Works

1. Game Start: The game starts with a ball in the center of the screen and two paddles on both sides.

2. Control the Paddles: Use specific keys on the keyboard to control the paddles.

3. Bounce the Ball: The ball bounces off the paddles and the top and bottom edges of the screen. When a paddle catches the ball, the player's score increases by 1.

4. Game Over: The game ends when the ball escapes past a paddle, and the final scores are displayed.

## How to Play

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Run the Python script to start the game:
