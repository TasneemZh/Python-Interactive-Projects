# Snake Game Project

Welcome to the Snake Game! This project is programmed in Python using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles!

## Project Overview

This project brings the nostalgic snake game to life using Python. Control the snake to eat food, grow in length, and try to achieve the highest score without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Key Features

🗝️ Smooth Controls: Responsive arrow key controls for seamless gameplay.

🗝️ Randomized Food Placement: Food appears at random locations on the screen, providing a fresh challenge each time.

🗝️ Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as the snake grows longer with each piece of food eaten.

🗝️ Game Over Detection: The game accurately detects collisions with walls and the snake's body to end the game and display the final score.


## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to control the snake:

⬆️: Move up

⬇️: Move down

⬅️: Move left

➡️: Move right


Ensure you have the following Python package installed:

```bash
pip install turtle
```

Run the Python script to start the game:
```bash
python main.py
```
