# Stock News Alert Project

Welcome to the Stock News Alert Project! This project monitors stock price changes and sends news alerts if significant changes are detected.

## Project Overview

This project checks for a 5% increase or decrease in a stock's price between yesterday and the day before yesterday. If such a change is detected, it fetches the latest news articles related to the company and sends the news headlines and brief descriptions via SMS.

## How It Works

- Check Stock Price:

    Uses the Alpha Vantage API to get the closing stock prices for yesterday and the day before yesterday.


- Calculates the percentage change:

    If it is greater than or equal to 5%, it proceeds to fetch news articles.


- Fetch News Articles:

    Uses the News API to get the top 3 latest news articles related to the company.


- Send SMS Alerts:

    Uses the Twilio API to send an SMS with the article titles and brief descriptions to a specified phone number.
