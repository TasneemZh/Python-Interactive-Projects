# Turtle Drawings Project

Welcome to the Turtle Drawings Project where a variety of creative programs created by the Turtle graphics library can be found.

## Project Overview
This project includes several mini-programs that utilize the Turtle graphics library to create captivating visual art. These programs demonstrate different drawing techniques and utilize external packages like colorgram to enhance the artwork.

## Mini-Programs

1. Spirograph Drawing:

    Creates spirograph patterns with a beautiful color palette.


2. Shapes Drawing:

    Draws multiple geometric shapes, such as triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons, and more, in random colors.


3. Random Walk:

    Simulates a random walk where the turtle moves in different directions with different colors, creating a freestyle drawing.


4. Hirst Painting:

    Recreates a Hirst-like painting by extracting colors from an image using the colorgram package and painting dots with those colors.

Run the Python script for the program you want to see in action:
```bash
python spirograph_drawing.py
python shapes_drawing.py
python random_walk.py
python hirst_painting.py
```

But first, install the necessary packages using pip:
```bash
pip install turtle colorgram.py
```
