# Workout Tracker Project

Welcome to the Workout Tracker Project! This project helps you track your workouts and log them using APIs for a seamless fitness tracking experience.

## Project Overview

The Workout Tracker Project uses the Nutritionix API to fetch workout data based on user input and the Sheety API to log the workout details into a Google Sheet. This project simplifies the process of tracking your exercises, including their names, durations, and calories burned.

## How It Works

1. Fetch Workouts:

    Uses the Nutritionix API to get workout details based on user input.


2. Log Workouts:
